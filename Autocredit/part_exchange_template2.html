	<p class="font-bold margin-bottom-l">
		Terms and conditions
	</p>
	<p class="font-bold margin-bottom-l">
		You are advised to print and retain a physical copy of these terms and conditions
	</p>
	<p class="margin-bottom-xl">
		In these terms and conditions "we", "us", “VWG” or "our" means Volkswagen Group United Kingdom Limited
		(trading as Audi UK) a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (company number 514809) whose
		registered office is at Yeomans Drive, Blakelands, Milton Keynes, Bucks, MK14 5AN, United Kingdom. We may
		change these terms and conditions from time to time by updating this page of our website (the "Website" ).
		You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes. Your continued use
		of the Website will constitute acceptance of the amended terms and conditions.
	</p>
	<p class="font-bold margin-bottom-l">
		1. APPLICATION OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
	</p>
	<p class="margin-bottom-xl">
		1.1 These terms and conditions apply to your access and use of our valuation tool (“Tool”) available via the
		Website for the purposes of obtaining a free valuation (“Valuation”). 1.2 Please read these terms and
		conditions carefully and make sure that you understand them as by using the Tool to obtain a Valuation you
		agree to these terms and conditions. If you do not accept these terms and conditions, you will not be able to
		obtain a Valuation from the Website. 1.3 The Tools are for private non-commercial use by persons located in the
		United Kingdom only wishing to sell a car on their own behalf. You may not use the Valuation tools for
		commercial, business and/or resale purposes. We reserve the right to restrict your usage of the Tools and
		other data services to a maximum of three occasions within any ten day period. 1.4 By accessing and using the
		Website, in particular the Tools for the purposes of obtaining a Valuation, you warrant that you are aged 18
		years or over and that you are legally entitled to enter into contracts. 1.5 Please also read our Privacy and
		Cookie Policies which sets out how we gather and process your personal information when you access and interact
		with the Website.

		2. FREE VALUATION
	</p>
	<p class="margin-bottom-xl">
		2.1 To obtain a Valuation, enter the information requested, you must confirm that you agree to these terms and
		conditions and click ["Show my valuation"]. 2.2 We may not be able to provide a Valuation for vehicles that
		are: - 2.2.1 outside the age range of 3 months to 20 years old; - 2.2.2 outside the mileage range
		1,000 - 200,000 miles; - 2.2.3 specialist, customised or limited edition; - 2.2.4 in short supply or rare;
		or - 2.2.5 not registered from new in the United Kingdom. 2.3 For the purpose of obtaining a Valuation,
		mileage provided by you is rounded down to the nearest thousand miles.
	</p>

	<p class="font-bold margin-bottom-l">
		3. INTERPRETING YOUR VALUATIONS
	</p>
	<p class="margin-bottom-xl">
		3.1 Valuations are guides only and we do not warrant that you will be able to sell, or buy a vehicle for the
		Valuation received. The actual sale or purchase price is dependent on a number of additional factors,
		including colour and condition of the vehicle, supply of similar cars within the open market, promotions on
		offer and location. You agree that you may therefore achieve a sale or purchase of a used vehicle at a level
		higher or lower than the Valuation. 3.2 Valuations are provided on the basis of a single transaction between
		a domestic vehicle user buying or selling a vehicle in a private non-commercial capacity (typically known as
		an Average Private Sale price). 3.3 Valuations are based on the information provided by you and accordingly
		you must provide complete and accurate information for a Valuation. 3.4 The Valuations are based on
		assumptions for vehicles in a condition taking into account their age and normal usage, and are not adjusted
		to allow for any remedial work that has been undertaken to restore vehicles to an unusually high standard
		such as “concourse” show condition. This applies especially to vehicles that could be considered as "classic"
		models, or those that are collected by enthusiasts.

		servers on which the Website is stored or any server, computer or database connected to the Website; (iii)
